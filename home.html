    <h1>Brief intro into Uganda's Wildlife</h1>
    <div>
      Uganda is renowned for its rich and diverse wildlife, which includes some of Africa’s most iconic species, such as the endangered mountain gorillas, elephants, lions, and chimpanzees. The country's varied landscapes — from tropical rainforests to savannas and wetlands — provide vital habitats for over 1,000 species of birds and a variety of mammals, reptiles, and aquatic life.

      Conservation is crucial for Uganda as its wildlife faces threats from poaching, habitat loss, and climate change. Protecting these natural resources is not only essential for maintaining biodiversity but also for the country's economy, as eco-tourism generates significant revenue. By preserving wildlife and ecosystems, Uganda ensures the health of its environment and the well-being of future generations, while also contributing to global conservation efforts.
